# Animate Google Maps Directions
Short PHP and javascript scripts to animate and save Google Maps Directions

These little scripts show you how to achieve a series of simple, but useful tasks:

- generate a map using Google Maps API
- get directions for the map, creating a Path from A to B
- show these directions on the map
- save these directions to a file, to use them later
- animate the directions using a heatmap and a moving line along the path
